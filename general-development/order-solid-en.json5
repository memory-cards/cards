    question: 'Order items to get a <b>SOLID</b>',
    answers: [
      "a class should have only a single responsibility (i.e. changes to only one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class)",
      'software entities … should be open for extension, but closed for modification.',
      'objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.',
      'many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.',
      'one should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."',
