    comment: '<p>The High Resolution Time API allows you to perform precise timing measurements.</p>\n<p>To use the High Resolution Time API call <code>performance.now()</code>.</p>\n<p>The API will return a numeric value representing the current time (e.g <code>773665.7000000001</code>).</p>\n<p>The values returned by <code>performance.now()</code> always increase constantly and are not subject to time adjustments such as daylight savings and synchronization logic (NTP).</p>\n<p>The API can represent time with up to microsecond precision and is much more accurate than other JavaScript timing features such as <code>Date.now()</code> which return a value to the nearest millisecond.</p>\n<p>You can use the High Resolution Time API to measure the <strong>performance</strong> of your code:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">var start = performance.now();\n// do something\nvar end = performance.now();\nconsole.log("do something took " +\n           (end - start) + " milliseconds");\n</code></pre>\n<p>The API could also be used for precise timing in game, animation or audio logic.</p>\n',
