    comment: "<p>Before we jump in, a few words on JavaScript history. It was initially developed by <strong>Brendan Eich</strong> in just <em>10 days</em> under the code name <em>Mocha</em> in May 1995.</p>\n<p>The first version of JavaScript was called <em>LiveScript</em>, but this was later changed to JavaScript.</p>\n<p>Although JavaScript has the word “Java” in the title, the language has nothing to do with Java (probably a marketing ploy to capitalize on Java's popularity at the time).</p>\n<p>While some of JavaScript’s methods and syntax are similar to Java, JavaScript owes more to languages such as <em>Scheme</em> and <em>Self</em>.</p>\n",
