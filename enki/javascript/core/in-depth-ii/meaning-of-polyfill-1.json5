    comment: '<p>Polyfill (or polyfiller) is downloadable code which provides facilities that are not built into a web browser. It implements technology that a developer expects the browser to provide natively, providing a more uniform API landscape. </p>\n<p>A great example is <code>FlashCanvas</code>, implementation of the HTML5 Canvas API using a Flash plug-in. A rare commercial polyfill, it comes in a paid version, as well as a free version, which lacks a few advanced features like shadows.</p>\n<p>Another example could be polyfilling <code>String.prototype.startsWith()</code> with the following snippet:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">if (!String.prototype.startsWith) {\n  String.prototype.startsWith = \n   function(searchString, position) {\n     position = position || 0;\n     return this.indexOf(searchString,\n            position) === position;\n  };\n}\n</code></pre>\n',
