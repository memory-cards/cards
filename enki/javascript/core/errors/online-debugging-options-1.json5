    comment: '<p>It can be useful to quickly test a bit of code without having to create HTML and JavaScript files.</p>\n<p>One way to do this is to use an <em>online JavaScript environment</em>.</p>\n<p>There are many options available but some of the better known sites are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>codepen.io</li>\n<li>jsbin.com</li>\n<li>js.do</li>\n<li>jsfiddle.net</li>\n<li>pythontutor.com</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As well as running JavaScript these sites often allow you to reference common external libraries such as jQuery, Angular and React which saves you from downloading and setting them up.</p>\n<p>Online debugging options are also great for <strong>sharing</strong> code with others.</p>\n<p>This can be very useful when you are posting a question on a forum site - you are much more likely to get a response if you can provide a running example of your issue.</p>\n',
