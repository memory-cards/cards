    comment: '<p>The <code>catch</code> clause of a <code>try...catch</code> statement is <strong>block</strong> scoped. This is different to the rest of JavaScript which is <strong>function</strong> scoped.  </p>\n<pre><code>try {\n  // ...\n}\ncatch (err) {\n   // err is block scoped\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Many linters fail to recognise that it is valid to have multiple  <code>try...catch</code> statements in the same scope, all using <code>err</code>, without it being a repeated variable declaration.</p>\n',
