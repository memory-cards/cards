    comment: '<p>When your <em>Node.js</em> app is compiled with <strong>openssl crypto</strong> support, <code>npm</code> package manager  provides automatic  <strong>checksumming</strong> support.</p>\n<p>Since version <code>0.2.9</code> of npm, <strong>sha1 hashes</strong> get generated for all packages as they\'re published:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-bash">npm publish myProject\n</code></pre>\n<p>They are also verified after they are downloaded by other users.</p>\n<p>In case an error occurs during downloading, or if something gets corrupted in transit, <code>npm</code> will <strong>refuse to proceed</strong> with the installation.</p>\n<p>Checksumming in <code>npm</code> is completely silent and provides another layer of security for all packages.</p>\n',
