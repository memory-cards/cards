    comment: "<p>It's almost always better to use the newest version of a package as it often offers fixes or improvements to its functionality. As a package maintainer it is important to communicate any changes made in a release as it may break code[1] depending on the package.</p>\n<p>For package maintainers, there are some guidelines when it comes to versioning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the first version should be <em>1.0.0</em>, though it's not a necessity</li>\n<li>patch releases and bug fixes should increment the last number, <em>1.0.0</em> to <em>1.0.1</em></li>\n<li>minor releases and new features that don't break existing functionality should increment the middle number, <em>1.0.0</em> to <em>1.1.0</em></li>\n<li>major releases or changes which break backwards compatibility should increment the first number, <em>1.0.0</em> to <em>2.0.0</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can specify which updates to the packages you would want to receive:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the latest patch: <em>1.0</em> or <em>1.0.x</em> or <em>~1.0.0</em></li>\n<li>the latest minor release: <em>1</em> or <em>1.x</em> or <em>^1.0.0</em></li>\n<li>the latest major release: <em>* or </em>x*</li>\n</ul>\n",
