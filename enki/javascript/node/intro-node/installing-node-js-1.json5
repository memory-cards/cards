    comment: '<p>To setup a local environment to use Node.js both a text editor and the Node.js binary installables are required. JavaScript files can be created in any text editor (Notepad, Atom, Sublime) as long as the file has the extension <code>.js</code>. However, it’s recommended to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Webstorm which is a far more useful tool when programming.</p>\n<p>The latest version of Node is available to download from the Node website, once this has been downloaded and extracted, Node can be tested to ensure it’s working by running <code>node</code> from your terminal or command prompt:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-bash">$ node\n>\n</code></pre>\n<p>You should see a <code>></code> appearing under the <code>node</code> command. This means your installation was successful! You are now using the <code>REPL</code> terminal which we will explore in-depth in the next insight.</p>\n',
