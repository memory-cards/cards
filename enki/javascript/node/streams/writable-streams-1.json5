    comment: '<p>The <code>write()</code>  method is used to write data to a writable stream. Take the following example:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">var fs = require(‘fs’);\nvar rstream = fs.createReadStream\n                        (‘file.txt’);\nvar wstream = fs.createWriteStream\n                        (‘output.txt’);\n\nrstream.on(‘data’, function(data) {\n\n wstream.write(data);\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above example initiates both a readable stream and a writable stream. A callback function is then created which is called when data is read from the readable stream, this data is then written to <code>output.txt</code> using the writable stream.</p>\n<p>The <code>write()</code> method returns a boolean value acting as an indicator to whether the write operation was successful. If the write was successful and more data can now be written then <code>true</code>  is returned. If the write operation was unsuccessful then <code>false</code> is returned.</p>\n',
