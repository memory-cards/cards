    comment: '<p>Streams are unix pipes[1] allowing data to be read from a source and for data to be piped to a destination. A stream is effectively an <code>EventEmitter</code> with implementation of some special methods.</p>\n<p>These special methods define whether a stream is Readable, Writable, or Duplex (readable and writable). Readable streams allow for data to be read from a source and writable streams allow for data to be written to a destination.</p>\n<p>An example use of a Node stream is in a Node based HTTP server, <code>request</code> would be a readable stream, and <code>response</code> a writable stream. The filesystem, <code>fs</code>, module allows readable and writable streams to be implemented.</p>\n',
