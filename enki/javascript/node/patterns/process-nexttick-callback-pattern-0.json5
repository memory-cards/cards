    comment: '<p><em>Event loop</em> can be viewed as a queue of callbacks that are processed by <strong>Node</strong> on consequent <strong>ticks</strong>.</p>\n<p><code>process.nextTick()</code> basically defers the execution of an action until the next tick of the <em>Event Loop</em>.</p>\n<p>Basic behaviour of <code>process.nextTick()</code> can be achieved with <code>setTimeout(fn,0)</code>, yet the former provide better performance.</p>\n<p>Its usage proves useful when you want to interleave the execution of a <strong>CPU</strong> intensive task with other events.</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">function compute() {\n    // complicated calculations    \n    process.nextTick(compute);}\n//other events\ncompute();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, the execution of <code>compute()</code> will be reserved for the next tick of the event loop, after other events are queued in it.</p>\n<p><code>process.nextTick()</code> is also used to keep callbacks truly asynchronous:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">function asyncFn(data, callback) {\n    process.nextTick(function() {\n        //callback value logic\n  });\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>It is also used before emitting an event to provide correct functionality.</p>\n',
