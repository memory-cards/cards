    comment: '<p>When applications become more complex, the <em>reduction function</em> can and should be split into separate functions, managing different parts of the <strong>state</strong> as to keep the code logic tidy and scalable. This is done by using the special method <code>combineReducers()</code>.</p>\n<p>This function will transform an object with different reducer functions as parameters into a single reducer function that can be passed to <code>createStore()</code>.</p>\n<p>Call the function:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">combineReducers({\n  firstReducer : myFirstReducer,\n  secondReducer : mySecondReducer });\n</code></pre>\n<p>The keys define the shape of the <strong>state object</strong>.</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">{firstReducer,secondReducer}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The common practice is to be consistent with name such as that reducers have the same name as the slices they manage. Therefore, <strong>ES6</strong> shorthand notation can be used:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">combineReducers({firstReducer,\nsecondReducer});\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is equivalent to:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">combineReducer({firstReducer:firstReducer,\n  secondReducer:secondReducer});\n</code></pre>\n',
