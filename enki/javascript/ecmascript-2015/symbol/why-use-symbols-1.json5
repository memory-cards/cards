    comment: '<p>As symbols are always unique they are great for library authors to defining values without fear of overwriting anything existing e.g.</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">var companyKey = Symbol();\nvar obj = {}\nwindow[companyKey] = "Enki";\n</code></pre>\n<p>They can also be used as a kind of constant within an application:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">const highDiscountLevel = Symbol();\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is better than just defining a const string as there would be nothing to stop a developer doing the following:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">const highDiscountLevel = "high";\n\n//uh oh 2 consts\n//representing same thing\nconst anotherDiscountLevel = "high";\n</code></pre>\n<p>Probably Symbols most important purpose is to introduce non-breaking changes to JavaScript let\'s talk about this next.</p>\n',
