    comment: "<p>If you're familiar with JavaScript, you're already familiar with EcmaScript. It's what you're already writing in. The question is- how up-to-date is the JavaScript you're writing? ECMAScript is a continually evolving language, with new features and developments released annually. It is actively maintained by a very large, diverse, global committee of developers from across the entire JavaScript community. These developers represent industrial, corporate, and public sectors; open source, education, and more.</p>\n<p>ECMAScript (or ES) is a <em>specification</em> standardized by a group called Ecma International, . It was created to standardize how JavaScript is written across platforms. Browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari track this standard by adding features to their implementation of JavaScript. This is implemented at the <em>runtime</em> layer, in the engines underneath the browser; V8, Sunspider, Chakra, and others.</p>\n<p>Bookmark this insight to receive a list of public trackers for version compatibility- a handy chart to have for any ECMAScript developer!</p>\n",
