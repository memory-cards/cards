    comment: "<p>ECMAScript 6 (also referred to as ECMAScript 2015 and ES6) is the latest version of the standard managed by ECMA International that JavaScript now tracks.</p>\n<p>Version 6 introduces many exciting features that make it easier than ever to write robust and succinct code.</p>\n<p>We'll be looking at features such as constants, arrow functions, the spread/rest operator, default parameters, extensions to existing types, and much more!</p>\n<p>It's important to note that if you intend to use some of the features that we will discuss, support for them varies widely across browsers and is changing all the time.</p>\n<p>If you want to make use of these new features (and you should!) but also want to ensure that your code will run for a broad audience you will probably want to make use of a processor/compiler such as <em>Babel</em> that will transform the newer code into code understood by older platforms.</p>\n",
