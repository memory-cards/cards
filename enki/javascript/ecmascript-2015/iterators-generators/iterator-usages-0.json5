    comment: "<p>Of course, iterators can work with any sequence of items you want so you could use iterator for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More efficient resource and memory usage as values are computed on demand and not held in memory</li>\n<li>Mathematical sequences of numbers e.g. the classic example is Fibonacci numbers</li>\n<li>Records from the database</li>\n<li>Infinite sequences (remember to never return done as true!)</li>\n<li>Generate sequences of id's</li>\n<li>As a state machine, e.g. you might have different discount levels for a customer and could move from new customer to regular to VIP</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's a fair amount of code to create even a simple iterator. ES6 offers another way that is usually a better option for most scenarios called <strong>Generators</strong> which we will look at next.</p>\n",
