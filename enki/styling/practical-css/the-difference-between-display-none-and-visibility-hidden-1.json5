    comment: '<p><code>visibility:hidden</code> defines that an element is rendered on the page but not visible. Space on the page will be allocated for this element.</p>\n<pre><code class="language-css">#foo {\n  visibility:hidden;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>display:none</code> defines that an element is not rendered on the page and thus does not appear. Unlike <code>visibility:hidden</code>, page space is not allocated for the element, allowing other elements to fill in.</p>\n<pre><code class="language-css">#foo {\n  display:none;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Keep in mind that <code>display:none</code> will trigger a DOM reflow, while <code>visibility:hidden</code> will not.</p>\n<p>A reflow is a recomputation of the page\'s layout, calculating positions and dimensions, being an expensive process.</p>\n',
