    comment: '<p>When we talk about "Cascading Style Sheets", what do we mean by <em>cascade</em>?\nStyle blocks <em>cascade</em> from the top of the style sheet to the bottom, like a waterfall.</p>\n<p>Here\'s an example:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-css">p {\n  color: red;\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\np {\n  color: green;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>First, select all paragraphs on the page, then set their font color to <code>red</code> and their style to <code>bold</code>. Then, we select the all paragraphs again and set their font color to <code>green</code>.</p>\n<p>Because the selector that sets their color to <code>green</code> comes after the selector that sets their color to <code>red</code>, it will <em>override</em> the initial value. Paragraphs will still be <code>bold</code> as the second selector doesn\'t specify another value for the <code>font-weight</code> property.</p>\n<p>The same cascading property works for declaring different values in the same selector:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-css">/* paragraphs will be green */\np {\n  color: red;\n  color: green;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>CSS doesn\'t always behave like this, however. There is a property of selectors, called <strong>specificity</strong>, which breaks the rule. We will talk about specificity in the course of next workout.</p>\n',
