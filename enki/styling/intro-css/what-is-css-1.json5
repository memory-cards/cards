    comment: '<p><strong>CSS</strong>, also known as <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>, is a styling language that can be applied to HTML, XML or SVG documents. Here\'s an example:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-css">p {\n  color: orange;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>CSS is very important to get to know about, because pretty much every website nowadays uses it to customize HTML elements.</p>\n<p>As for any project, functional separation of the files is recommended. Following this rule, we can split the files of a website into three categories: <em>structure</em>, <em>presentation</em> and <em>behavior</em>.</p>\n<p>CSS is the one that takes care of the <em>presentation</em>. (HTML takes care of the structure and JavaScript looks after the behavior.)</p>\n<p>There are several advantages to splitting the roles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No code duplication, as the CSS file can be used for similar looking pages of the website.</li>\n<li>A consequence of less code is less data to be transmitted, which is important for users with a slow internet connection.</li>\n<li>The <em>presentation</em> can be changed without modifying the <em>content</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CSS can change the HTML elements\' color and size, their positioning, and can even animate them.</p>\n',
