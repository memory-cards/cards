    comment: '<p><em>Sass</em> allows the creation of <strong>partial</strong> CSS/SCSS files that you can include in other Sass files through imports. This feature promotes modular code, thus keeping files easier to maintaining.</p>\n<p>All you have to do to mark a file as <em>partial</em> is to include an underscore before its name: if the partial should style the header, a good name would be <code>_header.scss</code>. The underscore lets Sass know that the file is partial and a CSS file should not be generated for it.</p>\n<p>Partials are used with the <code>@import</code> directive, of which we will talk in the next insight.</p>\n',
