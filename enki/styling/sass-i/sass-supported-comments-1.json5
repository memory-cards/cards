    comment: '<p>There are two ways to comment out code in Sass. The first is a single-line comment:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-css">// a double forward slash is used for\n// commenting out single lines of code\n</code></pre>\n<p>The second is a multiline comment:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-css">/*\nEverything in between the multiline comment\nparentheses is commented out. Multiline\ncomments can be used to comment out multiple\nlines of code such as Sass declarations.\n*/\n</code></pre>\n<p>Any single-line comments are removed when CSS code is generated from Sass code, all multiline comments will be preserved as they use the CSS comment syntax.</p>\n',
