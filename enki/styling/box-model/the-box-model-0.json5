    comment: '<p>According to the <strong>box model</strong>, every element on the page is a rectangular box that may have <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, <code>margin</code>, <code>padding</code> or <code>border</code>.</p>\n<p>The dimensions of such a box are calculated by summing the values of the above mentioned properties. To better understand the formula, consider this example:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-css">div{\n  width: 600px;\n  height: 200px;\n  border: 4px solid blue;\n  margin: 20px;\n  padding: 10px;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><img
