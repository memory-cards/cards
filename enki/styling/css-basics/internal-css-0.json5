    comment: '<p>The next two ways of writing CSS code do not require an external <code>.css</code> file - both structure (HTML) and style (CSS) can live inside the same HTML file.</p>\n<h3>Internal CSS</h3>\n<p>CSS code can be written inside a <code>&#x3C;style></code> tag, in the <code>head</code> part of the HTML document:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-html">&#x3C;head>\n  &#x3C;style>\n    p{\n      color: red;\n    }\n    #my-div{\n      background: purple;\n    }\n   &#x3C;/style>\n&#x3C;head>\n&#x3C;body>\n &#x3C;p>&#x3C;/p>\n &#x3C;div id="my-div">&#x3C;/div>\n&#x3C;/body>\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, it abides by the same declaration rules as they would normally appear inside a <code>.css</code> file - selectors, curly brackets etc.</p>\n<h3>Inline CSS</h3>\n<p>Every HTML element can accept a <code>style</code> attribute. As the styling is specific to the element, <em>no selector</em> is needed. Therefore, the code would be the one <em>inside</em> the curly brackets in a <code>.css</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-html">&#x3C;div style="background: green;\n      font-size:30px;">&#x3C;/div>\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, this is bad practice as it cannot be overridden by an external CSS file and may cause unexpected problems. This is because inline CSS has the highest priority when rendering.</p>\n<p><em>Note:</em> Even though there are multiple ways in which you can style an HTML page, the recommended one is using external files, as it splits the resources into <em>structure</em> and <em>style</em>.</p>\n',
