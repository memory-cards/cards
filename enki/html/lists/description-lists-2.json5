    comment: '<p>The HTML <code>&#x3C;dl></code>, or the <strong>Description List</strong> element is used to represent a description list or a glossary. The items/terms in the <code>&#x3C;dl></code> element are represented with the <code>&#x3C;dt></code> element, and the descriptions are specified with the <code>&#x3C;dd></code> element. The purpose for this is organizing the information in logical ways for search engines. It also provides clear methods for styling with CSS, so don\'t overlook this method when seeing that the default styling appears that it just indents the content.</p>\n<p>Simple example:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-html">&#x3C;dl>\n  &#x3C;dt>Enki&#x3C;/dt>\n  &#x3C;dd>\n    Founded in 2015,\n    Enki is a team of developers,\n    educators, and designers.\n    We represent 7 countries, 8 timezones,\n    9 spoken languages, and 1 goal\n    — supporting lifelong learners.\n  &#x3C;/dd>\n&#x3C;/dl>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Result:</p>\n<p><img
