    comment: '<p>The HTML input forms of type <code>checkbox</code> are square boxes that can be ticked or checked to be activated. They allow you to either select none, a single or more values at once.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> A similar input form type is <code>radio</code>. This input type is also clickable, however, unlike with checkboxes, if multiple options are present, the radio buttons can have only one option checked at a time.</p>\n<p>Example with multiple checkboxes:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-html">&#x3C;form>\n  &#x3C;legend>\n    Choose favorite music genre/s\n  &#x3C;/legend>\n    &#x3C;div>\n     &#x3C;input\n        type="checkbox"

unique value that is used to identify each checkbox. Also, each button has an id. This id is used with the <code>&#x3C;label></code> element\'s <code>for</code> attribute to link the label to the checkbox.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: By adding the label, we allow the user to have a larger clickable area for the checkboxes. That is, if the user presses anywhere in the <code>folk</code> label, that label\'s checkbox will be selected. This option is really useful as it makes it easier to select a value both for big and small screen sizes.</strong></p>\n<p>The \'name\' &#x26; \'value\' attributes work as a pair in keeping track of the data sent and are both important to use with checkboxes. For instance, if the user picks <code>folk</code> and <code>reggae</code> the name/value pairs would be <code>genre=folk&#x26;genre=reggae</code>. This is something the client never sees as the data is sent upon submission of the form. </p>\n<p>When this data is submitted and sent to the server, it can be captured as an array of related values.</p>\n<!--Handling multiple checkboxes with a single server variable: \'[Check out Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18745456/handle-multiple-checkboxes-with-a-single-serverside-variable)\'-->\n<p>Furthermore, you can add a <code>checked</code> attribute to make a checkbox checked by default.

In this state, you can\'t tell if the checkbox is toggled on or off. Checkboxes in this state have a horizontal line in the box. The most common use for this is when a checkbox option has multiple checkbox sub-options within it. If all sub-options are selected, then the parent checkbox is also selected. On the other hand, if any of the sub-options have a different state from one another the parent checkbox is in the indeterminate state.</p>\n<p><img src="%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20style%3D%22width%3A100%25%22%20viewBox%3D%220%200%20320%20183%22%3E%3Cg%20fill%3D%22none%22%20fill-rule%3D%22evenodd%22%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%22320%22%20height%3D%22183%22%20fill%3D%22%23FFF%22%20rx%3D%229%22%2F%3E%3Ctext%20fill%3D%22%23000%22%20font-family%3D%22ArialMT%2C%20Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2216%22%3E%3Ctspan%20x%3D%2294%22%20y%3D%2291%22%3EBook%3C%2Ftspan%3E%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20fill%3D%22%23000%22%20font-family%3D%22ArialMT%2C%20Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2216%22%3E%3Ctspan%20x%3D%2236%22%20y%3D%2231%22%3EComplete%20the%20recipe%3C%2Ftspan%3E%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20fill%3D%22%23000%22%20font-family%3D%22ArialMT%2C%20Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2216%22%3E%3Ctspan%20x%3D%2256%22%20y%3D%2255%22%3EEnchantment%20table%3C%2Ftspan%3E%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ccircle%20cx%3D%2260.5%22%20cy%3D%2285.5%22%20r%3D%222.5%22%20fill%3D%22%23000%22%2F%3E%3Ccircle%20cx%3D%2260.5%22%20cy%3D%22104.5%22%20r%3D%222.5%22%20fill%3D%22%23000%22%2F%3E%3Ccircle%20cx%3D%2260.5%22%20cy%3D%22123.5%22%20r%3D%222.5%22%20fill%3D%22%23000%22%2F%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%2213%22%20height%3D%2213%22%20x%3D%2276.5%22%20y%3D%2279.5%22%20fill%3D%22%233B99FC%22%20fill-rule%3D%22nonzero%22%20stroke%3D%22%233795F8%22%20rx%3D%222%22%2F%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%2213%22%20height%3D%2213%22%20x%3D%2236%22%20y%3D%2243%22%20fill%3D%22%233B99FC%22%20fill-rule%3D%22nonzero%22%20stroke%3D%22%233795F8%22%20rx%3D%222%22%2F%3E%3Cpath%20stroke%3D%22%23FFF%22%20stroke-linecap%3D%22square%22%20d%3D%22M39.5%2049.5h6m-6%201h6%22%2F%3E%3Cpath%20stroke%3D%22%231B78DC%22%20stroke-linecap%3D%22square%22%20d%3D%22M40.5%2051.5h4%22%2F%3E%3Cpath%20fill%3D%22%23FFF%22%20fill-rule%3D%22nonzero%22%20d%3D%22M83%2087h1v1h-1zm1-2h1v1h-1zm-2%203h1v1h-1zm-1%200h1v1h-1zm-1-1h1v1h-1zm-1-1h1v1h-1z%22%2F%3E%3Cpath%20fill%3D%22%23AFCDEC%22%20fill-rule%3D%22nonzero%22%20d%3D%22M79%2087h1v1h-1zm1%201h1v1h-1zm0-2h1v1h-1zm3-1h1v1h-1zm1-1h1v1h-1zm1-2h1v1h-1zm1%200h1v1h-1zm0%201h1v1h-1zm-4%204h1v1h-1zm-1%200h1v1h-1z%22%2F%3E%3Cpath%20fill%3D%22%231977DA%22%20fill-rule%3D%22nonzero%22%20d%3D%22M80%2089h1v1h-1zm1%201h1v1h-1zm1%200h1v1h-1zm1-1h1v1h-1zm1-2h1v1h-1zm1-1h1v1h-1zm1-2h1v1h-1zm-7%204h1v1h-1z%22%2F%3E%3Cpath%20fill%3D%22%23AFCDEC%22%20fill-rule%3D%22nonzero%22%20d%3D%22M81%2089h1v1h-1zm1%200h1v1h-1z%22%2F%3E%3Cpath%20fill%3D%22%23FFF%22%20fill-rule%3D%22nonzero%22%20d%3D%22M83%2086h1v1h-1zm2-2h1v1h-1zm0-1h1v1h-1z%22%2F%3E%3Ctext%20fill%3D%22%23000%22%20font-family%3D%22ArialMT%2C%20Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2216%22%3E%3Ctspan%20x%3D%2294%22%20y%3D%22111%22%3EDiamonds%3C%2Ftspan%3E%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20fill%3D%22%23000%22%20font-family%3D%22ArialMT%2C%20Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2216%22%3E%3Ctspan%20x%3D%2294%22%20y%3D%22129%22%3EObsidian%3C%2Ftspan%3E%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%2214%22%20height%3D%2214%22%20x%3D%2276%22%20y%3D%22117%22%20stroke%3D%22%23A5A5A5%22%20rx%3D%222%22%2F%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%2214%22%20height%3D%2214%22%20x%3D%2276%22%20y%3D%2299%22%20stroke%3D%22%23A5A5A5%22%20rx%3D%222%22%2F%3E%3Cpath%20stroke%3D%22%23979797%22%20stroke-linecap%3D%22square%22%20stroke-width%3D%222%22%20d%3D%22M33.5%2025.5h-13m0%200v135.05925m1-.05925H298m.5%200V26.3637m-116-.8637l116-.5%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fg%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E" alt="checkbox-indeterminate"></p>\n<!--This `indeterminate` state is shown with CSS styling and CSS Tricks.
