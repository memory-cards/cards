    comment: '<p>The HTML input form of type <code>radio</code> is used to create radio buttons, which are usually held in radio groups. These buttons are rendered as small empty circles that fill in upon selection.</p>\n<p>Unlike checkboxes, <code>radio</code> buttons can have only one element selected per group. When one button is selected, any button selected before it will immediately be deselected. Of course, this only applies to the radio group where the <code>radio</code> button was selected.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: Radio buttons are called <code>radio</code> buttons because they look and operate like old-fashioned radios. When a button is pressed, any button pressed before it is pulled out, and you can\'t have 2 buttons pressed at the same time.</strong></p>\n<p>When creating radio buttons, each button within the same radio group is given the same <code>name</code>.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-html">&#x3C;form>\n &#x3C;p>\n   Please select your gender:\n &#x3C;/p>\n  &#x3C;div>\n   &#x3C;input\n      type="radio" id="gender1"\n      name="gender" value="male">\n   &#x3C;label\n      for="gender1">Male\n   &#x3C;/label>\n\n   &#x3C;input\n      type="radio" id="gender2"\n      name="gender" value="female">\n   &#x3C;label\n      for="gender2">Female\n   &#x3C;/label>\n\n   &#x3C;input\n      type="radio" id="gender3"\n      name="gender" value="other">\n   &#x3C;label\n      for="gender3">Other\n   &#x3C;/label>\n  &#x3C;/div>\n  &#x3C;div>\n    &#x3C;button\n      type="submit">Submit\n    &#x3C;/button>\n  &#x3C;/div>\n&#x3C;/form>\n</code></pre>\n<p><img src="%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20style%3D%22width%3A100%25%22%20viewBox%3D%220%200%20320%20110%22%3E%3Cg%20fill%3D%22none%22%20fill-rule%3D%22evenodd%22%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%22320%22%20height%3D%22110%22%20fill%3D%22%23FFF%22%20rx%3D%229%22%2F%3E%3Ctext%20fill%3D%22%23000%22%20font-family%3D%22ArialMT%2C%20Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%3E%3Ctspan%20x%3D%2221%22%20y%3D%2230%22%3EPlease%20select%20your%20gender%3A%3C%2Ftspan%3E%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20fill%3D%22%23000%22%20font-family%3D%22ArialMT%2C%20Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214.5%22%3E%3Ctspan%20x%3D%2242%22%20y%3D%2264%22%3EMale%3C%2Ftspan%3E%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20fill%3D%22%23000%22%20font-family%3D%22Arial-BoldMT%2C%20Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2211.5%22%20font-weight%3D%22bold%22%3E%3Ctspan%20x%3D%2227%22%20y%3D%2285%22%3ESubmit%3C%2Ftspan%3E%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20fill%3D%22%23000%22%20font-family%3D%22ArialMT%2C%20Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214.5%22%3E%3Ctspan%20x%3D%2299%22%20y%3D%2264%22%3EFemale%3C%2Ftspan%3E%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ccircle%20cx%3D%2229%22%20cy%3D%2261%22%20r%3D%227%22%20fill%3D%22%23FFF%22%20stroke%3D%22%239E9E9E%22%2F%3E%3Ccircle%20cx%3D%2229%22%20cy%3D%2261%22%20r%3D%227%22%20fill%3D%22%23FFF%22%20stroke%3D%22%239E9E9E%22%2F%3E%3Ccircle%20cx%3D%2288%22%20cy%3D%2261%22%20r%3D%227%22%20fill%3D%22%23FFF%22%20stroke%3D%22%239E9E9E%22%2F%3E%3Ccircle%20cx%3D%22160%22%20cy%3D%2261%22%20r%3D%227%22%20fill%3D%22%23FFF%22%20stroke%3D%22%239E9E9E%22%2F%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%2252%22%20height%3D%2217%22%20x%3D%2220.5%22%20y%3D%2272.5%22%20stroke%3D%22%23D3D3D3%22%20rx%3D%224%22%2F%3E%3Ctext%20fill%3D%22%23000%22%20font-family%3D%22ArialMT%2C%20Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214.5%22%3E%3Ctspan%20x%3D%22173%22%20y%3D%2264%22%3EOther%3C%2Ftspan%3E%3C%2Ftext%3E%3C%2Fg%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E" alt="radio-empty"></p>\n<!--[View CodePen](https://codepen.io/enkidevs/pen/QBdKZJ)--> \n<p>In the example above, we have 3 <code>radio</code> buttons, each with the same name - <code>gender</code> and each with a unique <code>value</code> that is used to identify each button. Also, each button has an <code>id</code>. This <code>id</code> is used with the <code>&#x3C;label></code> element\'s <code>for</code> attribute to link the label to the radio button.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: By adding the label, we allow the user to have a larger clickable area for the radio button. That is, if the user presses anywhere in the <code>gender1</code> label, that label\'s button will be selected. This option is really useful as it makes it easier to click both for big and small screen sizes.</strong></p>\n<p>Once a user presses a button, and submits the result, the form\'s data is sent in a <code>name/value</code> pair. For instance, if they pick <code>female</code>, the form\'s data will include the line <code>gender=female</code> upon submission.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if no value is specified, and the user selects the same button, the result will be sent in the form of <code>gender=on</code>, and since this isn\'t really helpful, you should always include the <code>value</code> attribute. Similarly, if no button is selected, the form won\'t submit at all, since it has no value to report.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you want your form with radio buttons to have a default value, you should add the <code>checked</code> attribute.</p>\n<p>Same example with <code>checked</code> added:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-html">&#x3C;form>\n &#x3C;p>\n   Please select your gender:\n &#x3C;/p>\n  &#x3C;div>\n   &#x3C;input\n      type="radio" id="gender1"\n      name="gender" value="male" checked>\n   &#x3C;label\n      for="gender1">Male\n   &#x3C;/label>\n\n   &#x3C;input\n      type="radio" id="gender2"\n      name="gender" value="female">\n   &#x3C;label\n      for="gender2">Female\n   &#x3C;/label>\n\n   &#x3C;input\n      type="radio" id="gender3"\n      name="gender" value="other">\n   &#x3C;label\n      for="gender3">Other\n   &#x3C;/label>\n  &#x3C;/div>\n  &#x3C;div>\n    &#x3C;button\n      type="submit">Submit\n    &#x3C;/button>\n  &#x3C;/div>\n&#x3C;/form>\n</code></pre>\n<p><img src="%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20style%3D%22width%3A100%25%22%20viewBox%3D%220%200%20320%20110%22%3E%3Cg%20fill%3D%22none%22%20fill-rule%3D%22evenodd%22%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%22320%22%20height%3D%22110%22%20fill%3D%22%23FFF%22%20rx%3D%229%22%2F%3E%3Ctext%20fill%3D%22%23000%22%20font-family%3D%22ArialMT%2C%20Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%3E%3Ctspan%20x%3D%2221%22%20y%3D%2230%22%3EPlease%20select%20your%20gender%3A%3C%2Ftspan%3E%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20fill%3D%22%23000%22%20font-family%3D%22ArialMT%2C%20Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214.5%22%3E%3Ctspan%20x%3D%2242%22%20y%3D%2264%22%3EMale%3C%2Ftspan%3E%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20fill%3D%22%23000%22%20font-family%3D%22Arial-BoldMT%2C%20Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2211.5%22%20font-weight%3D%22bold%22%3E%3Ctspan%20x%3D%2227%22%20y%3D%2285%22%3ESubmit%3C%2Ftspan%3E%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20fill%3D%22%23000%22%20font-family%3D%22ArialMT%2C%20Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214.5%22%3E%3Ctspan%20x%3D%2299%22%20y%3D%2264%22%3EFemale%3C%2Ftspan%3E%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ccircle%20cx%3D%2229%22%20cy%3D%2261%22%20r%3D%227%22%20fill%3D%22%23FFF%22%20stroke%3D%22%239E9E9E%22%2F%3E%3Ccircle%20cx%3D%2229%22%20cy%3D%2261%22%20r%3D%227%22%20fill%3D%22%233B99FC%22%20stroke%3D%22%233B99FC%22%2F%3E%3Ccircle%20cx%3D%2229%22%20cy%3D%2261%22%20r%3D%222.5%22%20fill%3D%22%23FFF%22%2F%3E%3Ccircle%20cx%3D%2288%22%20cy%3D%2261%22%20r%3D%227%22%20fill%3D%22%23FFF%22%20stroke%3D%22%239E9E9E%22%2F%3E%3Ccircle%20cx%3D%22160%22%20cy%3D%2261%22%20r%3D%227%22%20fill%3D%22%23FFF%22%20stroke%3D%22%239E9E9E%22%2F%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%2252%22%20height%3D%2217%22%20x%3D%2220.5%22%20y%3D%2272.5%22%20stroke%3D%22%23D3D3D3%22%20rx%3D%224%22%2F%3E%3Ctext%20fill%3D%22%23000%22%20font-family%3D%22ArialMT%2C%20Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214.5%22%3E%3Ctspan%20x%3D%22173%22%20y%3D%2264%22%3EOther%3C%2Ftspan%3E%3C%2Ftext%3E%3C%2Fg%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E" alt="radio-selected"></p>\n<p>Furthermore, you can also have as many radio groups as you require per web page or document.
