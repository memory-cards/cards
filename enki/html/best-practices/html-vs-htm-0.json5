    comment: '<p><code>.html</code> and <code>.htm</code> are both file extensions for HTML.</p>\n<p>The only difference is that <code>.htm</code> was used in the early days when operating systems like DOS did not support file extensions past 3 characters. </p>\n<p>There was no 3 character limitation for early Mac users, so they often used the full <code>.html</code> extension when Unix systems (even the web servers) still had to use <code>.htm</code> creating some technical problems. </p>\n<p>Today, limiting extensions to 3 characters is no longer necessary on any operating system.</p>\n',
