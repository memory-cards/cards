    comment: '<p>The HTML <code>&#x3C;figure></code> element is used to represent self-contained content. Also, the <code>&#x3C;figure></code> element frequently has a <code>&#x3C;figcaption></code> element within it which is used to display a caption of the content and must be either the first or last child of the <code>&#x3C;figure></code> element.</p>\n<p>The <code>&#x3C;figure></code> element is usually an image, code snippet, diagram, illustration, etc., which is referenced in the main flow of the document. Also, the <code>&#x3C;figure></code> elements content can also be moved to another part of the document without having any effect on the main flow.</p>\n<p>Example with a poem:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-html">&#x3C;figure>\n &#x3C;p>\n   Old cave, hidden door,&#x3C;br>\n   Carved ceiling, ancient floor,&#x3C;br>\n   Statue of old, a hero bold,&#x3C;br>\n   Sitting on his throne of gold,&#x3C;br>\n   King of legend, time forgot,&#x3C;br>\n   Now all that is left is for him to rot.\n &#x3C;/p>\n &#x3C;figcaption>&#x3C;cite>Old Cave&#x3C;/cite>.\n  Author: Unknown&#x3C;/figcaption>\n&#x3C;/figure>\n</code></pre>\n<!--[View CodePen](https://codepen.io/enkidevs/pen/YjqEWp)-->\n',
