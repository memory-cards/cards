This can be useful when your file is named <code>123z12zv824.docx</code> on your server, but you want it downloaded with something more friendly like <code>Enki%20Notes.docx</code>. Keep in mind that <code>%20</code> needs to replace any spaces in the filename.</p>\n<p>When the value within the download attribute is empty (like <code>download=""></code>, then the downloaded file will retain its original filename. Of course, since the file will be a local file for the user, they can always rename that file as they wish, too.</p>\n',
