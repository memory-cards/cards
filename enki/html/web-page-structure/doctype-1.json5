    comment: '<p>In HTML, every page, no matter the version of HTML it is written in, requires a doctype declaration telling the browser how to render the document properly.</p>\n<p>Technically, the doctype declaration isn\'t an HTML element, but a specific direction for browsers to understand they type of web page being delivered.</p>\n<p>The doctype declaration for HTML5 is:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-html">&#x3C;!DOCTYPE html>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Although the doctype declaration can be written both in lower and uppercase letters, it tends to be most widely accepted for <code>DOCTYPE</code> to be written in uppercase and <code>html</code> to be written in lowercase letters. </p>\n<p>This is only one doctype declaration for HTML5 compared to the three doctype declarations used for HTML 4.01 making this much similar for developers.</p>\n',
