    comment: '<p>The HTML <code>&#x3C;bdo></code>, or the <strong>Bidirectional Text Override</strong> element, is used to override the current directionality of text.

For instance, if you have a text that you want to be displayed in Arabic or Hebrew, next to translating the text, you would also use the <code>&#x3C;bdo></code> element along with its <code>rtl</code> attribute to make the text go Right-To-Left and become readable.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> It\'s also interesting that when text in English is written Right-To-Left in a web page, and the text is copied and pasted elsewhere by a user, that text will be displayed in regular Left-To-Right. This is because the text only appears Right-To-Left because of the HTML code, and without it, the text will display as written.</p>\n',
