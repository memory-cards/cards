    comment: '<p>HTML, which stands for, <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong> has had many versions over the years out of which, only a few are still being used today. These are HTML5, HTML4 and XHTML. HTML4 is the oldest HTML version still in use.</p>\n<p>HTML has a very loose syntax. A lot of closing tags are optional, for some you don\'t even need the open tag as well. This was good for new developers, however, it wasn\'t good in general, because not using proper syntax can cause your HTML to be read differently by different browsers. Because of this people combined HTML with XML(eXtensible Markup Language) and created XHTML.</p>\n<p>XHTML, which stands for <strong>eXtensible HyperText Markup Language</strong> is basically HTML defined as XML. It is almost identical to HTML with stricter rules.</p>\n<p>Unlike in HTML, XHTML elements have to be properly nested, always be closed, written in lowercase, and can have only one root element. Attributes in XHTML need quotation, cannot be used with minimization and require to be written in lowercase.</p>\n<p>The <code>doctype</code> declaration also differs for each version.</p>\n<p>HTML5 has 1 Doctype declaration:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-html">&#x3C;!DOCTYPE html>\n</code></pre>\n<p>HTML4 and XHTML each have 3 types of Doctype declarations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Frameset</li>\n<li>Strict</li>\n<li>Transitional</li>\n</ul>\n<p>HTML4 Frameset:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-html">&#x3C;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC\n "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Frameset//EN"\n "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/frameset.dtd">\n</code></pre>\n<p>HTML4 Strict:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-html">&#x3C;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC\n  "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"\n  "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">\n</code></pre>\n<p>HTML4 Transitional:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-html">&#x3C;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC\n  "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"\n  "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">\n</code></pre>\n<p>XHTML Frameset:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-html">&#x3C;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC\n  "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Frameset//EN"\n  "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD\n  /xhtml1-frameset.dtd">\n</code></pre>\n<p>XHTML Strict:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-html">&#x3C;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC\n  "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"\n  "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD\n  /xhtml1-strict.dtd">\n</code></pre>\n<p>XHTML Transitional:</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC\n "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"\n  "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD\n  /xhtml1-transitional.dtd">\n</code></pre>\n<p>A lot of elements from HTML4 were deprecated and made obsolete in HTML5. Deprecated means that even though these elements can be used to style how HTML is displayed, it\'s better to use CSS instead. Some of these deprecate HTML elements are <code>&#x3C;basefont></code>, <code>&#x3C;center></code>, <code>&#x3C;font></code> and <code>&#x3C;strike></code> and these were all used to style typography. </p>\n<p>Additionally, HTML5 has none of the presentational attributes which were used in HTML4. This is because handling those functionalities is much better with CSS.</p>\n<p>Also, HTML5 has many new features that HTML4 doesn\'t have. Some of these are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>audio and video for multimedia content</li>\n<li>track to provide text tracks for the video element</li>\n<li>embed for plugin content</li>\n<li>new geolocation features</li>\n</ul>\n',
