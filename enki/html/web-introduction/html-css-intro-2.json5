    comment: '<p><strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>HTML</strong> are the core languages used for creating web pages and web-based applications. <strong>HTML</strong> was invented in 1989, while <strong>CSS</strong> was invented in 1996.</p>\n<p><strong>HTML</strong>, or <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong> is a markup language for creating the structure and content of a webpage using text, images, links, and containers. Meanwhile <strong>CSS</strong>, or <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>, is used to modify the design and display of those <strong>HTML</strong> elements.</p>\n<p><strong>HTML</strong> is made up of content between <code>&#x3C;tags></code>, whereas <strong>CSS</strong> is made of selectors followed by a {declaration block}.</p>\n<p>When creating a website, all of your unique HTML and CSS files for the same website are usually located inside one primary folder.</p>\n',
