    comment: "<p><code>CSS</code> or <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong> is a <code>stylesheet</code> language used to describe the presentation of an HTML, XML, or XHTML document. It's used to provide styling for text, images, &#x26; links.</p>\n<p>In short, CSS is used to create responsive layouts, animations, styling text, and positioning containers. By applying CSS, you add the look and feel that you'd like to your websites.</p>\n<p>However, CSS is not good for inserting media, creating links, and it also doesn't allow math expressions and database storage.</p>\n",
